This problem was asked by Goldman Sachs.

You are given N identical eggs and access to a building with k floors. Your task is to find the lowest floor that will cause an egg to break, if dropped from that floor. Once an egg breaks, it cannot be dropped again. If an egg breaks when dropped from the xth floor, you can assume it will also break when dropped from any floor greater than x.

Write an algorithm that finds the minimum number of trial drops it will take, in the worst case, to identify this floor.

For example, if N = 1 and k = 5, we will need to try dropping the egg at every floor, beginning with the first, until we reach the fifth floor, so our solution will be 5.

This problem is known as the "Egg Dropping Puzzle," and it's a classic problem in dynamic programming. Let me walk you through the problem, including the approach to solve it.

### Problem Breakdown:
You are given:
- **N** identical eggs.
- **k** floors of a building.

Your goal is to determine the **minimum number of drops** needed in the **worst-case scenario** to find the **lowest floor** that will cause an egg to break.

**Key Points to Consider:**
1. If you drop an egg from a certain floor:
   - If it breaks, you need to test the floors below it with the remaining eggs.
   - If it doesn't break, you continue testing the higher floors with the same number of eggs.

2. If you have **1 egg** and **k floors**, you need to start from the 1st floor and check every floor sequentially (since breaking the egg would leave you without any eggs), so the number of drops in the worst case is **k**.

3. If you have **N eggs** and **k floors**, the problem becomes more complex because you can afford to drop the egg from any floor and potentially lose it. The challenge is to minimize the number of drops in the worst case.

### Approach:
We can solve this using **dynamic programming** by defining a 2D table where:
- Rows represent the number of eggs.
- Columns represent the number of floors.

Let **dp[i][j]** represent the minimum number of drops needed with **i eggs** and **j floors**.

**Base cases:**
- If you have 1 egg and j floors, the minimum drops required is **j** because you need to check every floor sequentially.
- If you have i eggs and 1 floor, the minimum drops required is **1** because you only need to drop it from that floor.

**Recurrence relation**:
For **i eggs** and **j floors**, the minimum number of drops required can be found by trying to drop an egg from each floor, and then considering two cases:
1. The egg breaks.
2. The egg doesn't break.

For each drop, the worst-case number of drops is:
- **max(dp[i-1][x-1], dp[i][j-x])**, where:
  - **dp[i-1][x-1]** is the result if the egg breaks.
  - **dp[i][j-x]** is the result if the egg doesn't break.

To minimize the maximum number of drops, we take the minimum of the maximums over all floors, which gives us the following equation:
- **dp[i][j] = 1 + min(max(dp[i-1][x-1], dp[i][j-x])) for all x in [1, j]**

### Algorithm:

```python
def egg_drop(n, k):
    # dp[i][j] will represent minimum drops needed with i eggs and j floors
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base case: 1 egg -> check every floor
    for j in range(k + 1):
        dp[1][j] = j

    # Base case: 0 or 1 floors
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 0
        dp[i][1] = 1

    # Fill the dp table for all eggs and floors
    for i in range(2, n + 1):  # for eggs
        for j in range(2, k + 1):  # for floors
            dp[i][j] = float('inf')
            for x in range(1, j + 1):
                res = 1 + max(dp[i-1][x-1], dp[i][j-x])
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], res)

    return dp[n][k]
```

### Explanation:
- We initialize a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` holds the minimum number of drops required for `i` eggs and `j` floors.
- We handle the base cases where:
  - With one egg, we need to check every floor (so it takes `j` drops for `j` floors).
  - With one floor, it takes only one drop, regardless of the number of eggs.
- Then, we use the recurrence relation to fill the table, ensuring we minimize the number of drops in the worst case.
  
### Example:
For **N = 1** egg and **k = 5** floors, we would drop the egg from each floor until it breaks, resulting in 5 drops in the worst case.

For **N = 2** eggs and **k = 5** floors, using dynamic programming, the minimum number of drops required would be less (since you can use both eggs to reduce the number of trials).

The key is balancing between exploring high floors and keeping enough eggs to continue testing lower floors if necessary.





Absolutely! There are several ways to optimize the egg-dropping problem further as a senior software developer. Letâ€™s go through three advanced approaches that improve the efficiency beyond the basic dynamic programming solution.

### 1. **Binary Search Optimization on Floors (O(N * K log K))**
   In the initial dynamic programming solution, we used a linear search across all floors (`for (let x = 1; x <= j; x++)`), which is inefficient. A smarter way is to apply **binary search** over the floors to find the optimal floor to drop the egg.

#### Key Idea:
When searching for the worst-case floor, we can use **binary search** to find the critical floor where the result changes from "egg breaks" to "egg doesn't break." This can reduce the inner loop from O(K) to O(log K).

#### Optimized Code:

```javascript
function eggDrop(eggs, floors) {
    const dp = Array.from({ length: eggs + 1 }, () =>
        Array(floors + 1).fill(0)
    );

    for (let j = 1; j <= floors; j++) {
        dp[1][j] = j;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i <= eggs; i++) {
        dp[i][1] = 1;
        dp[i][0] = 0;
    }

    for (let i = 2; i <= eggs; i++) {
        for (let j = 2; j <= floors; j++) {
            let low = 1, high = j;
            dp[i][j] = Infinity;

            while (low <= high) {
                const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
                const breaks = dp[i - 1][mid - 1];
                const noBreaks = dp[i][j - mid];

                const worstCaseDrops = 1 + Math.max(breaks, noBreaks);

                // Adjust the binary search range based on the results
                if (breaks > noBreaks) {
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }

                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], worstCaseDrops);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[eggs][floors];
}

// Test case
console.log(eggDrop(2, 100)); // Efficient for large inputs
```

### Explanation:
- Instead of doing a linear search, we use binary search to determine the optimal floor to drop the egg. This cuts down the search time to O(log K).
- By doing so, the overall time complexity becomes **O(N * K log K)**, a significant improvement over the O(N * K^2) solution.

---

### 2. **Mathematical Approach (O(N * log K))**
   Another approach is based on finding the minimum number of trials by using mathematical reasoning rather than relying solely on dynamic programming.

#### Key Idea:
Instead of considering the problem from the bottom up (which floor to drop from), we can flip the problem and ask **how many floors can we cover with a given number of eggs and drops**.

1. We define a recursive relation to track how many floors we can cover if we have `m` drops and `n` eggs.
2. If an egg breaks, we reduce the problem to `n-1` eggs and `m-1` drops.
3. If it doesn't break, we reduce the problem to `n` eggs and `m-1` drops.

This leads to a relation:  
`dp[m][n] = dp[m-1][n-1] + dp[m-1][n] + 1`

#### Optimized Code:

```javascript
function eggDrop(eggs, floors) {
    let drops = 0;

    // dp[drops][eggs] = maximum floors we can cover
    const dp = Array.from({ length: floors + 1 }, () => Array(eggs + 1).fill(0));

    while (dp[drops][eggs] < floors) {
        drops++;
        for (let i = 1; i <= eggs; i++) {
            dp[drops][i] = dp[drops - 1][i - 1] + dp[drops - 1][i] + 1;
        }
    }

    return drops;
}

// Test case
console.log(eggDrop(2, 100)); // More efficient, covers more floors quickly
```

### Explanation:
- This approach accumulates the number of floors that can be tested with a given number of eggs and drops.
- By iteratively increasing the number of drops, we find the minimum number of drops needed to cover all floors.
- This method has a **time complexity of O(N * log K)**, which is significantly better, especially when `K` is large.

---

### 3. **Optimized Mathematical Solution using Binomial Coefficients (O(N log K))**
   This approach improves on the previous method by leveraging **binomial coefficients** to calculate the number of floors that can be tested with `m` drops and `n` eggs.

#### Key Idea:
The number of floors that can be tested with `n` eggs and `m` drops can be calculated using binomial coefficients:
- `C(m, 1)` represents testing 1 floor with 1 drop.
- `C(m, 2)` represents testing 2 floors with 2 drops.
- The binomial coefficient `C(m, n)` calculates how many combinations of floors can be tested.

The goal is to minimize `m` such that `C(m, n) >= floors`.

#### Optimized Code:

```javascript
function binomialCoefficient(m, eggs, floors) {
    let res = 0;
    let coefficient = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i <= eggs && res < floors; i++) {
        coefficient = coefficient * (m - i + 1) / i;
        res += coefficient;
    }

    return res;
}

function eggDrop(eggs, floors) {
    let low = 1, high = floors;

    // Binary search to find the minimum number of drops
    while (low < high) {
        const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);

        if (binomialCoefficient(mid, eggs, floors) >= floors) {
            high = mid;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return low;
}

// Test case
console.log(eggDrop(2, 100)); // Fastest approach for large inputs
```

### Explanation:
- We use a **binary search** to find the minimum number of drops `m` such that the number of floors we can test with `n` eggs and `m` drops is greater than or equal to the number of floors in the problem.
- The **binomial coefficient** calculation helps us quickly determine the number of floors we can test in each iteration.
- This solution also has a **time complexity of O(N log K)** and is highly efficient for large inputs.

### Summary of Efficient Methods:
1. **Binary Search on Floors** â€“ Reduces complexity to **O(N * K log K)** by applying binary search over floor numbers.
2. **Mathematical Approach** â€“ Uses an iterative strategy to find the minimum drops based on how many floors can be covered with given drops and eggs. Time complexity: **O(N * log K)**.
3. **Binomial Coefficient Approach** â€“ Leverages mathematical combinations (binomial coefficients) to calculate the minimum number of drops efficiently, also with **O(N log K)** time complexity.

Each approach improves the efficiency, making it suitable for larger problem sizes, depending on the exact constraints.
